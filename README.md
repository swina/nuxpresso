## What is Nuxpresso?

**NUXPRESSO** is a website generator based on block driven page design.

Using **MOKAStudio visual blocks builder** you compose your page according to the pieces of information you need to publish.

You can reuse created blocks, change layout, css classes can be customized, HTML elements can be added, copied, duplicated, removed. Your blocks are filled like a form, you stack them and create a page.

Thus means enabling maximum reusability and design control while allowing content changes with clear boundaries.

> NUXPRESSO is markup, js and styling coupling applied to webpages. All of this without coding.

You can create shareable blocks that can be used for rich editing experiences in a UI in different projects just exporting/importing them.

The ultimate scope is to build a website that has the cost and time reduction of reusing well known information archetypes expressed as blocks (head, call for action, slider, footer, etc.).
